= {KOGITO} on {OPENSHIFT}

You can deploy {KOGITO} microservices on {OPENSHIFT} for cloud implementation. In this architecture, {KOGITO} microservices are deployed as OpenShift pods that you can scale up and down individually to provide as few or as many containers as required for a particular service. You can use standard OpenShift methods to manage the pods and balance the load.

To help you deploy your {KOGITO} microservices on OpenShift, {PRODUCT} provides an operator:

* *{PRODUCT} {KOGITO} Operator*: An operator that guides you through the deployment process. The operator is based on the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[Operator SDK] and automates many of the deployment steps for you. For example, when you give the operator a link to the Git repository that contains your application, the operator can automatically configure the components required to build your project from source and deploy the resulting services.
