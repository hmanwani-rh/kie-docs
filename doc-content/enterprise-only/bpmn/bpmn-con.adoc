= Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0
The Business Process Modeling and Notation Version 2.0 (BPMN2) specification is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification that defines standards for graphically representing a business process, defines execution semantics for the elements, and provides process definitions in XML format.

A process is defined or determined by its process definition. It exists in a knowledge base and is identified by its ID or other properties.

|===
|Label
|Description

| *Name*
| Enter the name of the process.

| *Documentation*
| Describes the process. The text in this field is included in the process documentation, if applicable.

| *ID*
| Enter an identifier for this process, such as `orderItems`.

| *Package*
| Enter the package location for this process in your {PRODUCT} project, such as `org.acme`.

| *ProcessType*
| Specify whether the process is public or private (or null, if not applicable).

| *Version*
| Enter the artifact version for the process.

| *Ad hoc*
| Select this option if this process is an ad hoc subprocess. (Currently not supported.)

| *Process Instance Description*
| Enter a description of the process purpose.

| *Imports*
| Click to open the *Imports* window and add any data object classes required for your process.

| *Executable*
| Select this option to make the process executable as part of your {PRODUCT} project.

| *SLA Due Date*
| Enter the date when the service level agreement (SLA) expires.

| *Process Variables*
a| Add any process variables for the process. Process variables are visible within the specific process instance. Process variables are initialized at process creation and destroyed on process completion. Variable *Tags* provide greater control over the variable behavior, such as whether the variable is `required` or `readonly`. For more information about variable tags, see
ifdef::PAM[]
{URL_DESIGNING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES}#variables-con_designing-business-processes[_{DESIGNING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES}_].
endif::[]

| *Metadata Attributes*
| Add any custom metadata attribute name and value that you want to use for custom event listeners, such as a listener to implement some action when a metadata attribute is present.

| *Global Variables*
|  Add any global variables for the process. Global variables are visible to all process instances and assets in a project. Global variables are typically used by business rules and constraints, and are created dynamically by the rules or constraints.

A process is a container for a set of modeling elements. It contains elements that specify the execution workflow of a business process or its parts using flow objects and flows. Each process has its own BPMN2 diagram. {PRODUCT} contains the legacy process designer and the new process designer for creating BPMN2 diagrams. The new process designer has an improved layout and feature set and continues to be developed. Until all features of the legacy process designer are completely implemented in the new process designer, both designers are available in {CENTRAL} for you to use.
