= Logging process instances

Logging is a mechanism that allows you to store information about the execution of a process instance. You can log a process instance using a special event listener that listens to the {PROCESS_ENGINE} for any relevant events to be logged. Later, the information is stored separately from other non-log information that is stored either in the server built-in database (H2) or in a connected data source JPA or Hibernate.

You can use the `jbpm-audit` module that provides an event listener and allows you to store the information directly in a database using JPA or Hibernate. The log data is stored as follows:

* Process instance as `processinstancelog`
+
[id='fields_processinstancelog_{context}']
.Fields of the processinstancelog table
[cols="25%,50%,25%", options="header"]
|===

|`id`

|`end_date`

|`processid`

|`status`
|Status of a process instance
|Yes

|`parentProcessInstanceId`
|Process instance ID of a parent process instance

|`outcome`
|Outcome of a process instance such as error code
|Yes

Also, you can define your data model with custom information and use the process event listeners to extract the information.
