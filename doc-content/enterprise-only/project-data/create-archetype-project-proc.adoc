= Creating a project using archetypes

Archetypes are projects that are installed in Apache Maven repositories and contain a specific template structure. You can also generate parameterized versions of the project templates using archetypes. When you use an archetype to create a project, it is added to the Git repository that is connected to your {PRODUCT} installation.

.Prerequisites
* You have created an archetype and added it to the *Archetypes* page in the {CENTRAL} *Settings*. For information about creating archetypes, see the https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html[Guide to Creating Archetypes].

* You have set a default archetype in your space in {CENTRAL}.

For more information about archetypes management, see {URL_CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}[{CONFIGURING_CENTRAL}].

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click *Add Project*.
. Type the project name and description in the *Name* and *Description* fields.
. Click *Configure Advanced Options*.
. Select the *Based on template* checkbox.
. If you want to use an archetype other than default archetype, click on the default archetype and select an archetype from the drop-down.
. Click *Add*.

The *Assets* view of the project opens.
